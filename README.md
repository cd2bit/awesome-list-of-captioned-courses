## Explaining How Spreadsheet Categories Works
1. **Platform/Course - URL**
    - Any platform that offers courses, which all or majority of them are captioned/subtitled e.g. Lynda, Treehouse, Pluralsight, etc.
    - Any course that is captioned/subtitled, which is usually an one-off course or created independently outside of its hosted platform, e.g. Udemy or YouTube 
2. **Topics - Up to Top Five Most Known For**
    - What is the platform/course known for, both broadly (e.g. Web Development, Technology) and/or narrowly (e.g. HTML, CSS, JavaScript) or more specifically (e.g. ReactJS, NodeJS) 
3. **Captions/Subtitles**
    - Captions: Text _with_ descriptions for background noises and audio cues 
    - Subtitles: Text _without_ descriptions for background noises and audio cues
4. **Auto-Captions**
    - Created by speech recognition technology and since it's generated by machine learning algorithms, quality can wildly vary
5. **Transcripts**
    - Occassionally, courses offer transcripts for off-line readings or do not offer captions/subtitles/auto-captions for their videos
5. **Pricing Model**
    - **Free:** Entirely free without any purchase needed
    - **Free Course/Lesson(s):** Some are free while others are not
    - **Free Tier:** Usually, in conjunction with Paid Tier
    - **Free Trial:** Free for short period of time
    - **Paid:** An one-time purchase
    - **Paid Tier:** Usually, a monthly or yearly subscription
6. **Notes**
    - Examples that may help those searching in the spreadsheet: Has a niche course that may be of interest like "Development for Amazon Alexa," the quality of auto-captions, unusual pricing model, etc.

Sometimes, we come across platforms/courses that aren't captioned/subtitled and seemingly, making no progress to make these accessible
